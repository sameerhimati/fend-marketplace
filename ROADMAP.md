## Issue Creation Guidelines

When creating issues for Claude Code instances, reference specific sections:

**Format:**
```
Title: [ROADMAP-1.2] Fix duplicate status displays in pilot list
Reference: Phase 1, Task 2 - UI/UX Cleanup
Priority: HIGH
Files: templates/pilots/pilot_list.html
```

**Section References:**
- **1.1** = Notifications System
- **1.2** = UI/UX Cleanup  
- **1.3** = Legal Documents
- **1.4** = Landing Page
- **1.5** = Admin Refactor
- **1.6** = Profile/Deals

This allows for focused, actionable issues that Claude Code can work on independently while maintaining progress toward MVP launch goals.
