## 🔧 Required Environment Variables for Production

Current missing/temporary values in `.env.prod`:
```bash
# Stripe Production Settings (currently using test keys)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Optional: Pre-created Stripe Price IDs (if not using auto-creation)
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
STRIPE_STARTUP_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
STRIPE_STARTUP_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_...
```

**Current Priority**: 
1. Test the platform end-to-end with the fresh deployment
2. Set up Stripe production keys and payment flow
3. Configure basic monitoring (UptimeRobot, error tracking)
